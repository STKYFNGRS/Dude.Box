WEB3 INTEGRATION

Wallet Integration:
- Coinbase Wallet SDK
- Smart/Regular wallet support
- Chain configuration
- Provider management

Security Considerations:
- Chain ID validation
- Provider disposal
- Session management
- Error recovery

Testing Requirements:
- Connection flows
- Chain switching
- Error scenarios
- Provider interactions

I'd like for you to keep in mind. Our onchain/page.txt should offer two options. On the left, Smart wallet SDK. On the right is a wallet aggregator where they can connect with exsisting wallet extensions.
