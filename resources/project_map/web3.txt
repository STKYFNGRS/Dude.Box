WEB3 INTEGRATION

Wallet Integration:
- Coinbase Smart Wallet SDK
  - Simplified provider configuration
  - Using OnchainKit for RPC
  - Direct Base chain integration
  
- Regular Wallet Support
  - MetaMask compatibility
  - Coinbase Wallet extension
  - Chain configuration handled by providers

Chain Configuration:
- Base Mainnet (8453)
- Base Sepolia (84532)
- RPC endpoints managed by OnchainKit

Key Learnings:
1. Let SDKs handle chain management
2. Use built-in provider features
3. Avoid redundant RPC configurations
4. Maintain separate flows for smart/regular wallets
5. Use environment variables for chain IDs

Testing Requirements:
- Connection flows for both wallet types
- Chain switching handled by providers
- Error scenarios
- Provider interactions

Security Considerations:
- Provider disposal
- Session management
- Error recovery
