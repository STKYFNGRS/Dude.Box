DUDE.BOX ONCHAIN TROUBLESHOOTING
Last Updated: November 29, 2024

COMMON ISSUES & RESOLUTIONS

1. SDK Integration
----------------
Issue: Over-complication of wallet connection
Resolution: 
- Simplified to direct SDK usage
- Removed custom RPC handling
- Let SDK handle connection details

2. Type System
----------------
Issue: Complex type hierarchy causing build errors
Resolution:
- Simplified types to match SDK
- Removed custom type extensions
- Clear interface definitions

3. State Management
----------------
Issue: Multiple simultaneous connections possible
Resolution:
- Added walletType state
- Implemented mutual exclusivity
- Clear connection states

4. Build Process
----------------
Issue: Vercel build failures
Resolution:
- Proper typing
- Removed unnecessary abstractions
- Clean separation of concerns

LESSONS LEARNED

1. SDK Usage
- Trust the SDK's built-in functionality
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction layers
- Use SDK preferences for wallet types

2. Type System
- Keep types simple and focused
- Match SDK type definitions
- Avoid complex type hierarchies

3. Architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Simple state management
- Direct SDK integration

FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS

1. Monitoring
- Track connection success rates
- Monitor wallet type usage
- Track error occurrences

2. Performance
- Connection speed optimization
- State updates efficiency
- Error handling improvements

3. Security
- Regular SDK updates
- Connection validation
- State consistency checks
